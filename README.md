# Weather Prediction with LSTM

This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the precipitation type based on weather features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "weatherHistory.csv", which contains historical weather data including various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, as well as the precipitation type. This dataset is used to train and evaluate the LSTM model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow (Keras)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the code interactively)

## Installation

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the code files.
2. Place the "weatherHistory.csv" dataset in the same directory as the code files.
3. Run the provided Python script or Jupyter Notebook to train the LSTM model and make predictions.

## Results

After making predictions, the script or notebook will display the predicted precipitation type for each sample in the test data.
